# KTP App 

Welcome to the app (to be) used by the Kappa Theta Pi Theta chapter at the University of Chicago.

This app is used for the rush/pledge process, events tracking, and for members to get general announcements. 

## Documentation


## Contribution Rules

1. Read the documentation
2. All contributions should be added as [issues]() on their own [branch](). Ideally, all issues will be as atomized as possible. 
3. Pull requests must be approved by the team in charge of the project before merging with the *development* branch. The main branch is for production releases only.
